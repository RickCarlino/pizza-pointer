# Pizza Pointer

Always know how to get to a Pizza place near [Rev3](http://rev3dupage.com/). Part of a talk I did for [BurbDev](http://www.meetup.com/BurbDev/).

# Is it any good?

Yes.

# Live Demo

It's [up here](http://computer_programmer.neocities.org/) for now.

# How do I do it?

 0. Clone this repo
 1. `bower install`
 2. `npm install`
 3. `gulp watch`
 4. Start your dev work. Files will be served to `localhost:3000`, which is good.
